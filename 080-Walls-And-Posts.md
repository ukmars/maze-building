# Maze Walls and posts

UKMARS has provisionally accepted a design for 3D printed walls and posts that use a resin printer. Overall, task of making walls witha resin printer is made much easier with this technology. In particular, it is signoificantly quicker to make walls this way thn with fmore traditional FDM printers. The candidate wall design can be made in two parts so that even the smalleds resin printer can be used by individuals to make walls.

For a full contest maze there will be a need for some 300 each posts and walls.

Maze posts will have 6.0mm diameter pegs that are to be inserted into the maze. All posts will have to have pegs that are long enough to join sections fo maze together as all the deigns rely upon that method of location. If the overallmaze thickness is to be at least 12mm, then that should probably be the length of the peg. In practice a little less is better - probably 11mm.
