# Maze Walls and posts

The current maze walls used in UK contests are made from MDF covered with white, self adhesive vinyl. Although resin and FDM printed walls have their advantages, it was apparent that the simplest, cheapest and fastest method for making new walls was to make more MDF walls. This method also gives the highest degree of compatibility with current walls.

For a full contest maze there will be a need for some 300 each posts and walls. 

Maze posts will have 6.0mm diameter pegs that are to be inserted into the maze. All posts will have to have pegs that are long enough to join sections fo maze together. If the overall maze thickness is to be at least 12mm, then that should probably be the length of the peg. In practice a little less is better - probably 11mm with a small chamfer on the end to aid assembly.
