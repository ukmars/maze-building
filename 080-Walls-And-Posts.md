# Maze Walls and posts

Although not yet considered in detail, the walls and posts need to be part of the consideration for manufacture and storage. 

In the first instance, it is assumed that maze posts will have 6.0mm diameter pegs that are to be inserted into the maze. At least some posts will have to have pegs that are long enough to join sections fo maze together as all the deigns rely upon that method of location. If the overallmaze thickness is to ne at least 12mm, then that should probably be the length of the peg. 

It would be most convenient if every post is suitable for use as a joiner although 'special' joining posts with stronger pegs are likely to be desireable.
