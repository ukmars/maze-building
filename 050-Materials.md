# Materials

Practically speaking there are few choices of material for the base (prices have been taken from a single supplier and so are only a relative guide, not absolute). Note that layered designs are not absolutely required to use the same material for all layers though there is some risk of differential expansion.

- **Plywood**. Typically 5.5mm thick and avaialble usually with a very thin hardwood veneer. This is lighter than MDF and more resistant to moisture and impact on fine edges. It is also perhaps less likely to be flat across a whole sheet. Varies a lot by supplier, Relatively cheap hardwood external grade stuff is common. Guide prices around £25/sheet. High quality Marine plywood in 6mm is likely to be £80/sheet and 6mm Birch plywood is about £76/sheet. Unless a known quality, named brand with guaranteed thickness can be found, plywood is probably not a safe choice for the top surface of the maze.

- **MDF**. Quality varies widely from very poor to very good. Moisture resistant varieties are better but not moisture proof. All MDF, including Medite should be sealed. MDF is about 20-25% more dense than plywood. Typically 6mm thick. MR is about £25/sheet. Because of the variability, generic MDF is not considered as a candidate in these notes.

- **Medite**. This is a high grade MDF, but much better than the stuff from your local DIY Store. Most importantly, it is a known quality not subject to the vagaries of your local builders merchant. It is probably what you (should) buy when looking for MDF for a laser cutter.If you want MDF, choose Medite. Also avaliable in 3mm and 4mm thicknesses. 6mm thickness about £28/sheet. MR variety £33/sheet

- **Valchromat** is the most widely available dyed MDF. Its properties are similar to MDF but the fibres are dyed before manufacture producing a consistent colour throughout the sheet. The thinnest sheets of Valchromat are 8mm which makes it good for a top layer but too thick for a three-layer design on all three layers. Surface properties are similar to Medite but it is possible to use it without any further paint of finish. A surface sealer might be wise though. Valchromat if _very_ expensive though and starts at £100 per sheet. 

- **Kitronic Dyed MDF** is a product that is dyed black throughout, very durable and availale in cut panels at a significantly better price than Valchromat. Cutting tests are needed for suitability with common laser cutters. The surface is very good and has high absorbtion of IR light.

## Stability
Note that, in general, plywood is more stable in the long term than MDF and unlikely to suffer lasting damage from excess moisture.
