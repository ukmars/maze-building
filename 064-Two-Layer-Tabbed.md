# Two Layer Staggered Tiles

### (3) 360mm square tiles, two layers

![classic-360mm-6.1mm-2-layer.png](resources/classic-360mm-6.1mm-2-layer.png)

Each tile would comprise two layers of material. The upper layer would be 360mm square and the lower layer 355mm square. Both pieces have an identical four-hole pattern for the posts. The upper layer is rotated 180 degrees about the centre hole to form the structure shown. Because the lower layer is smaller, there will be an automatic clearance of 5mm to ensure that it is the upper surface that determines the alignment.

The post hole grid is set in with the hole centres starting 12mm from the edges. The overlap would thus be 24mm wide.

The layers would not need a shim between them.

It is likely that four of these tiles would be permanently fitted together to make 720mm square panels. Simple gluing would join the tiles and, in this case, the lower layer should also be 360mm square for strength.

Vertical alignment along joins would require that the lower layer had embedded nuts so that the upper layer could be screwed down onto it. Such a mechanism might involve either a screw with a through hole into which a post could be inserted or possibly a 6mm threaded peg on a post to act as a post and a clamping screw.

A total of 64 tiles or 16 panels would be needed for a classic maze.

Three sheets of material yields eighteen tiles for a finished area of 2.33m²

#### Advantages:

- Dimensionally, this proposal has the same advantages as the three layer option above
- Only one glued surface is needed and that needs no shim
- Fewer overall operations though, for a laser, the cutting time may not be reduced.
- Manual construction would be faster than with three layers
- Using 12mm material for the lower layer would make it possible to make walls from the waste

#### Disadvantages

- Laser cutting would still be very slow and only an option for those with suitable lasers.
- Manual cutting would be slow due to the large number of pieces.
- Alignment for assembly of the layers is a challenge because the three layers only share one hole. A jig would be required
- When made up into a full size maze, the result has no external border and needs additional pieces to fill in under the perimeter walls.
- With only one thin layer between tiles/panels. strength and stiffness may be a problem.
- Clamping screws imply a number of parts that need special manufacture.
- Clamping screws would be needed along every edge
- Vertical alignment depends entirely upon clamping screws
- Assembly would be slower

### (4) 540mm square tiles, two layers

Each tile would comprise two layers of material. The upper and lower layer would be 540mm square. Both pieces have an identical four-hole pattern for the posts. The upper layer is rotated 180 degrees about the centre hole to form the structure shown. Because the lower layer is smaller, there will be an automatic clearance of 5mm to ensure that it is the upper surface that determines the alignment.

Such a mechanism might involve either a screw with a through hole into which a post could be inserted or possibly a 6mm threaded peg on a post to act as a post and a clamping screw.

A total of 36 tiles panels would be needed for a classic maze.

Three sheets of material yields eight tiles for a finished area of 2.33m²

#### Advantages:

- Dimensionally, this proposal has the same advantages as the three layer option above
- Only one glued surface is needed and that needs no shim
- Fewer overall operations so manual construction would be faster than with three layers
- Using 12mm material for the lower layer would make it possible to make walls from the waste

#### Disadvantages

- Laser cutting would not be possible for the outlines but may be possible for the holes
- With only one thin layer between tiles/panels. strength and stiffness may be a problem
- Clamping screws imply a number of parts that need special manufacture.
- Clamping screws would be needed along every edge
- Vertical alignment depends entirely upon clamping screws
