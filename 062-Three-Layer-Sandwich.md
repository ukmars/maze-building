# Three Layer Sandwiched Tiles

### (1) 360mm square tiles, three layers

![classic-360mm-6.1mm-3-layer.png](resources/classic-360mm-6.1mm-3-layer.png)

Each tile would comprise three layers of material. The upper and lower layer would be 360mm square and the inner layer would be 355mm square. All three pieces have an identical four-hole pattern for the posts. The inner layer is rotated 180 degrees about the centre hole to form the structure shown. Because the inner layer is smaller, there will be an automatic clearance of 5mm inside the grooves to ensure that it is the outer surface that determines the alignment. (If the tiles are only ever used with the Top layer as the running sirface, There may be some benefit in making the bottom layer 355mm square).

The post hole grid is set in with the hole centres starting 12mm from the edges. The projecting tab would thus be 24mm wide.

The layers would need a shim between the bottom two layers to ensure sufficient clearance when fitting tiles together, A single thickness of 80gsm paper may suffice. Thicker shims could be made from a variety of paper materials such as brown Kraft paper. Alternatively, the lower layers (only) could be joined with carpet tape to privide adhesion and clearance in one go.

**It is likely that four of these tiles would be permanently fitted together to make 720mm square panels.**

A total of 64 tiles or 16 panels would be needed for a classic maze.

Three sheets of material yields eighteen tiles for a finished area of 2.33m²

#### Advantages:

- Each piece can be made on a typical unmodified diode laser in a single operation from rough cut blanks of at least 360mm square. Cuts and holes would be square and clean. Operator skill requirement would be relatively low.
- The design is very flexible for the home environment and tile storage would be relatively straightforward.
- Hobby-size CNC routers would be fast though these are not at all common in this size

#### Disadvantages

- Laser cutting would be very slow and only an option for those with suitable lasers.
- Manual cutting would be slow due to the large number of pieces.
- Alignment for assembly of the three layers is a challenge because the three layers only share one hole. A jig would be required
- All the three-layer approaches are more difficult to assemble in terms of ensuring alignment and flatness while glue dries.
- When made up into a full size maze, the result has no external border and needs additional pieces to fill in under the perimeter walls.

### (2) 540mm tiles, three layers

![classic-540mm-6.1mm-3-layer.png](resources/classic-540mm-6.1mm-3-layer.png)

Each tile would comprise three layers of material. The upper and lower layer would be 540mm square and the inner layer would be 535mm square. All three pieces have an identical nine-hole pattern for the posts. The inner layer is rotated 180 degrees about the centre hole to form the structure shown. Because the inner layer is smaller, there will be an automatic clearance of 5mm inside the grooves to ensure that it is the outer surface that determines the alignment. (If the tiles are only ever used with the Top layer as the running sirface, There may be some benefit in making the bottom layer 5355mm square).

The post hole grid is set in with the hole centres starting 12mm from the edges. The projecting tab would thus be 24mm wide.

The layers would need a shim between the bottom two layers to ensure sufficient clearance when fitting tiles together, A single thickness of 80gsm paper may suffice. Thicker shims could be made from a variety of paper materials such as brown Kraft paper. Alternatively, the lower layers (only) could be joined with carpet tape to privide adhesion and clearance in one go.

These tiles would be used individually.

A total of 36 tiles would be needed for a classic maze.

Three sheets of material yields eight tiles for a finished area of 2.33m²

#### Advantages

- Full maze has a substantial border and needs no special filler pieces.
- Individual tiles make a tiny maze for alignment.
- Easier storage of individual tiles with less chance of warping.
- Fewer overall operations in manufacture
- Alignment during manufacture much easier due to multiple overlapping holes

#### Disadvantages

- Entire tile cannot be cut with a 400mm diode laser (though the holes do fit within the envelope)
- Accurate saw cutting needed to make the pieces
- Almost certainly outside the size range of hobby CNC routers.
