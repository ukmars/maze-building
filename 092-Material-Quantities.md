# Material quantities

## Two layer, 540mm tiled Base

Needs 2x36 = 72 tile pieces.

Blanks would be 600mm square.

Cut from a single sheet of 1220x2440 material, there will be only 8 pieces possible.

That would require 9 sheets of raw material to make the 72 pieces to be cut into tiles.


## Walls using 12mm MDF sheet

Careful cutting permits 320 walls to be cut from one sheet of 12mm x 1220mm x 2440mm material using a thin blade saw (2mm kerf).
