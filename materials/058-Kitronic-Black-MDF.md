# Kitronic Black MDF

## Material

A big question remains on cuttability.

## 360mm Tiles

A single layer of 360mm tiles needs 64 pieces
Kitronic do black MDF at 600mmx400mm at £3.96 inc each in quantities of >= 100.

We would want to build 1½ or 2 mazes so 100 off pricing is good.

From a single 600x400 piece we can build a single 360mm tile with tabs and support. That would put the unit cost of a tile at £4 or £256 for a complete maze.

The same size Medite is just £2.40 making a similar design just £154. It would need paint.
(Kitronic, surprisingly, is the cheapest I can find for gut 6mm medite Premium)

A three-layer design in this tile size would use 192 pieces and waste 30% at a cost of £760.30


## 540mm tiles

A single layer of 540mmx540mm tiles needs 36 pieces.
For a special order of >= 100 pieces from Kitronic would work out at £6.24 inc each. For three layers, that would come to £674 for a maze using all black MDF. 

6mm Medite is available in 800mmx600mm pieces cosing £4.32 inc in 100-off quantities (presumably 600x600 would be available to special order) 

If two of the layers were Medite, the cost might reduce to 36×£6.24 + 72×£4.32 = £535.70. Less than that if the Medite can be had for a pro-rata price in 600mmx600mm (possibly about £460)

A single layer plus tabs solution in this size tile would use up two pieces per tile in order to provide adequate support. Thus the cost for a complete maze might be 2×36×£6.24 = £450 for all black. Using Medite for the tabs/supports would reduce the cost to 36×£6.24 + 36÷£4.32 = £380 if we threw away the waste or £345 if we could get 600mm square Medite prices pro-rata. (Or the builders payed cost for the waste :)
