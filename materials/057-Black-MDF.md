Only cut sheets are considered.

## Kitronic
[Kitronic laserable 6mm black MDF 600x400](https://kitronik.co.uk/collections/mdf/products/32161-6mm-laser-compatible-black-mdf-600mm-x-400mm-sheet) 
£4.20 inc each, for 10-99 pieces. For the 64 pieces needed to cover a maze that would be £269

Note that it is possible to construct a 360×360 tile _and_ its tabs/supports from a single 600×400 piece of raw material. This would make for a complete maze that does not need any further finishing.

For a special order of at least 100 pieces, Kitronic have quoted a price of £6.24 inc for pieces at 600mm x 600mm. To make one maze layer would require 36 of these at a total cost of £225. Not all the tabs/supports can be made from that size but a small amount of additional plain Medite would make the total cost comparable to the use of a 360×360 base tile.

Kitronic alo sell a laserable 3mm black painted MDF 600mm x 400mm for £1.86, inc each at qty 100. That is about £120 to cover a maze but is too thin for any use except as a skin on the top surface.
