### Structure Constraints

- The total thickness of the base material should be at least 12mm both for stiffness and to pemit full insertion of the post pegs.
- The thickness should not exceed 20mm in order to keep the weight of the panels down.
- The post hole grid shall be on 180mm centres and use 6.1mm holes to allow use of most existing contest posts.
- Gaps between panels in the assembled maze shall be less than 1mm wide
- Steps between panels shall be less than 0.5mm
- Joints between panels should be designed so that assembly is easy and positively holds the panels in their correct alignment both vertically and horizontally.
- The requirement for identical panels and the maximum size limit means that individual tiles or panels must be a multiple of 180mm in width and height. Practically, this means 360mm, 540mm or 720mm
- Panels need not be square though this is the simplest option.
- Best use should be made of typical 1220mm x 2440mm sheet goods. Since 720mm square tiles would be very wasteful in this regard, the basic tile size is restricted to 360mm x 360mm or 540mm x 540mm. Four of the 360mm tiles could be permanently assembled into panels of 720mm square.
- Available raw materials are likely to vary in dimension and properties. MDF is commonly available in 6mm thickness but this and 6.35mm (Â¼") may be mislabelled as each other. Plywood is more typically 5.5mm but actual samples are more likely to be a little less - even when sold at 6mm thick.
- So far as is practical, the structure should be resistant to, or tolerant of, high humidity or moisture.
