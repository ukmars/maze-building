### Structure Constraints

There are anumber of mechanical and materal constraints that need to be accounted for.

- The total thickness of the base material should be at least 12mm both for stiffness and to pemit full insertion of the post pegs.
- The thickness should not exceed 20mm in order to keep the weight of the panels down.
- The post hole grid shall be on 180mm centres and use 6.1mm holes to allow use of most existing contest posts.
- Gaps between panels in the assembled maze shall be less than 1mm wide
- Steps between panels shall be less than 0.5mm
- Joints between panels should be designed so that assembly is easy and positively holds the panels in their correct alignment both vertically and horizontally.
- The requirement for identical panels and the maximum size limit means that individual tiles or panels have been set at 540mm square
- Many commonly available materials are not produced to tight tolerances and may have a variable compsition even between batches. 
- So far as is practical, the structure should be resistant to, or tolerant of, high humidity or moisture.
