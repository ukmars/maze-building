# Building Mazes for Micromouse

For now this repository concerns itself only with the building of a maze for the classic micromouse contest. At some point this will be extended to the half-size contest.

Drawings and STL files for the maze base are in the [resources](./resources/) folder

Drawings and STL files for the walls and posts are in the [walls-and-posts](./walls-and-posts/) folder


These notes are divided into (not very well organised) sections:

- [Goals](./010-Goals.md)
- [Materials](./050-Materials.md)
- [Design](./060-Design.md)
- [Construction](./070-Construction.md)
- [Walls and Posts](./080-Walls-And-Posts.md)
- [Costs](./090-Costs.md)
