# Goals

- create a portable maze for classic micromouse contests
- use multiple identical tiles or panels (a panel is a maze section comprised of one or more tiles)
- limit panel size to no more than 750mm x 750mm
- design for distributed manufacture
- permits full 16x16 maze layout
- permits smaller and larger layouts if needed
- panels should be self-aligning vertically and positively located horizontally


#### Traditional designs

The common approach for a classic micromouse maze is nine sections of around 1mÂ² size. These are typically not all the same design and so must be fitted together in a particular fashion. These sections are large and heavy and do not fit in many family cars. The contest mazes in Japan and Taiwan and the APEC maze are made like this.

#### Tiles and Panels

For the current maze design UKMARS would like a more flexible design that uses smaller panels. Those panels should be large enough that fitting them together is not overly time consuming and yet small enough for easy transport in almost any domestic motor car. Individual panels should be light yet durable since they are likely to be poorly handled during transport and storage. All the panels should be identical so that they may be assembled with little complication and so that sub-sets may be assembled into custom layouts for special purposes and practice sessions.

#### Distributed Storage

Since the storage and transport of a maze by a single individual or organisation represents a single point of failure, we are making it possible for several members to hold a number of panels so that there is the best possible chance of a complete maze being available at any event. In the worst case, a smaller maze could still be assembled using however many panels are available on the day. Six maze holders have 10 tiles each. A complete maze needs 36 tiles so that only four mazeholders need to bring their tile sets. Spare tiles can be assembled into a practice maze. In the worst case, a maze containing a legal goal in the (7,7)-(8,8) cells can be assembled from a single set of ten tiles.

#### Distributed Manufacture

In a perfect world, the maze secions would be easy to make and indivuduals anywhere would be able to make panels that can be assembled interchangeably with those made by any builder. In practice, the tolerances required mean that the tiles will need to be manufactured using CNC machinery. The current tile sets have all be made in one place. If more tiles are required, care must be taken to ensure mechanical compatibility.
