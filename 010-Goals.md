# Goals

- create a portable maze for classic micromouse contests
- use multiple identical tiles or panels (a panel is a maze section comprised of one or more tiles)
- limit panel size to no more than 750mm x 750mm
- design for distributed manufacture
- permits full 16x16 maze layout
- panels shoulk be self-aligning vertically and positively located horizontally
- costs should be a significant factor in any choices

To get the question of cost addressed quickly, I estimate that even with economic materials, it may cost something like £45-50 per square meter to build a classic maze which amounts to £350-400 for the whole maze. This is for raw materials only. And relatively cheap ones at that. Note that Propoal 5 below is a low cost alternative.

#### Traditional designs

The common approach for a classic micromouse maze is nine sections of around 1m² size. These are typically not all the same design and so must be fitted together in a particular fashion. These sections are large and heavy and do not fit in many family cars.

#### Tiles and Panels

For a new maze building project UKMARS would like a more flexible design that uses smaller panels. Those panels should be large enough that fitting them together is not overly time consuming and yet small enough for easy transport in almost any domestic motor car. Individual panels should be light yet durable since they are likely to be poorly handled during transport and storage. All the panels should be identical so that they may be assembled with little complication and so that sub-sets may be assembled into custom layouts for special purposes and practice sessions.

#### Distributed storage

Since the storage and transport of a maze by a single individual or organisation represents a single point of failure, we hope to make it possible for several members to hold a number of panels so that there is the best possible chance of a complete maze being available at any event. In the worst case, a smaller maze could still be assembled using however many panels are available on the day.
