# Medite MDF

Medite is a tradename for a specific brand of Medium Density Fibreboard. Do not confuse this with the poor quality MDF you may have seen in your local DIY store or builder's merchant - though they may be able to supply it if asked.. This is a high quality material with excellent properties. Of particular importance is that by selecting a named brand (Medite Premier), there is some assurance that the thickness will be consistent regardless of where it is actually purchased. I believe the thickness tolerance is ±0.15mm.

While not moisture resistant, Medite Premium machines well and is suitable for use with a laser cutter.

Medite is widely available. One of the better-priced suppliers of full sheets and cut pieces is [Woodshop Direct](https://www.woodshopdirect.co.uk/plain-mdf-sheeting/medite-mdf-premier-sheet/). Their cut sheets are not suitable for direct use as maze tiles since they only specify an accuracy of ±1mm.

A well known supplier of materials for maker is [Kitronic](https://kitronik.co.uk/collections/mdf). they sell cut sheets generally sized to fit common laser cutters and CNC machines. Their sizes are not always obviously convenient but they do offer good prices and excellent service. There is no inear tolerance given for theirpanels
